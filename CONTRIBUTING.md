# Contributing to Praesidium

Welcome, and thank you for your interest in contributing to Praesidium!

There are many ways in which you can contribute, beyond writing code. The goal of this document is to provide a high-level overview of how you can get involved.

## Asking Questions

Have a question? Just open a new issue or send a e-mail to gps.135.gps@gmail.com and you should get a quick response.

## Providing Feedback

Your comments and feedback are welcome, you can send an e-mail to gps.135.gps@gmail.com to share your thoughts.

## Reporting Issues

Have you identified a reproducible problem in Praesidium? Have a feature request? We want to hear about it! Here's how you can make reporting your issue as effective as possible.

Before you create a new issue, please do a search in [open issues](https://github.com/DhruvKhemani/Praesidium/issues) to see if the issue or feature request has already been filed.

If you find your issue already exists, make relevant comments and add your [reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments). Use a reaction in place of a "+1" comment:

* üëç - upvote
* üëé - downvote

If you cannot find an existing issue that describes your bug or feature, create a new issue using the issue template.

### Writing Good Bug Reports and Feature Requests

File a single issue per problem and feature request. Do not enumerate multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue.

Do not add your issue as a comment to an existing issue unless it's for the identical input. Many issues look similar, but have different causes.

The more information you can provide, the more likely someone will be successful at reproducing the issue and finding a fix.

### Final Checklist

Please remember to do the following:

* Search the issue repository to ensure your report is a new issue

* Recreate the issue with a stable internet connection and no other applications running in the background

* Simplify your code around the issue to better isolate the problem

Don't feel bad if the developers can't reproduce the issue right away. They will simply ask for more information!
